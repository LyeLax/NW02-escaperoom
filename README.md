First install node v21.0.0 and express, useful tutorial [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-tutorial) assuming you're using vscode.
Recommended way is to use nvm, then:
`nvm use v21.0.0`
To make sure the version is correct.

Install pkg's and run:
When inside folder, run: 
- `npm install`
- `npm run player1`
Then, in another terminal:
- `npm run player2`

Then go to localhost:3000 in your browser, and localhost:3001 for player 2.
